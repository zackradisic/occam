            Vertex shader: vs_cel
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_cel_position = 0
                    ATTR_vs_cel_texcoord0 = 1
            Fragment shader: fs_cel
                Uniform block 'fs_params_cel':
                    C struct: fs_params_cel_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_fs_params_cel = 0
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Sample Type: SG_IMAGESAMPLETYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0
                Sampler 'smp':
                    Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_SAMPLE
                    Bind slot: SLOT_smp = 0
                Image Sampler Pair 'tex_smp':
                    Image: tex
                    Sampler: smp


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader cel = sg_make_shader(cel_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_cel':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

                },
            },
            ...});


    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]

        SLOT_smp = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'fs_params_cel':

        fs_params_cel_t fs_params_cel = {
            .iResolution = ...;
            .cell_shading = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_fs_params_cel, &SG_RANGE(fs_params_cel));
